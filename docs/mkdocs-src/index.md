# KIT Workbench (MkDocs)

KIT Workbench is a composite project

## Components
### Community Analysis

- [KISIA](#kisia)
- [RUM](#real-user-measurements)

#### KISIA

KISIA = ```Korsimoro Identity Systems Industry Analysis```

- Conference Databases

#### Real User Measurements

Real User Measurements are critical to objective
assessment of the performance of identity-tech
systems.

- [Map of V1]()
  There is a web site which shows data about the
  state of the Veres.One network

- [Map of Sovrin]()
  - What does Sovrin's deployment look like?

- [Map of BTCR]()


### Quality Assurance

For each code repository, does it work?  How
can you use it?  What are the hidden issues with
yarn, or npm, or pip, or docker, that get in the way?

Instead of following along with README files and
trying to get it all to work as advertised, you'll
have the ability to use an executing system and
work with it out of the bat - completely free of the
hassles of integrating.


### Education

The use of interactive computing notebooks facilitates the
generation of interactive, runnable, verisons of the
quickstarts and readmes, as well as other use-case
exploration and interoperability.


### After Warranty Support

Every attempt will be made to keep the KIT-Workbench
as current as possible, across all components in the
industry.  For this reason, the repository is open
and we welcome pull requests.

## Technology

### Jupyter/Interactive Computing

Build up the story/case for interactive computing.
