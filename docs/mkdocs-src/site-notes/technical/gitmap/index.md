# GitMap

The purpose of the gitmap is to connect the git infrastructure for
tracking submodules with a "named snapshot" of a set of repositories.

In this way it is possible to author a "snapshot" credential which attests,
recursively, to a snapshot from "the world of git servers".

## Git is not GitHub

Note - git here is git, not github.
