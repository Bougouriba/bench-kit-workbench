## What is it

## How does Git Work

## The Necessary Existence of a JSON Snapshot

## The Sufficiency of a JSON Snapshot

## Write Oriented Trust Anchoring

The specific write credentials are leveraged against a provider KYC, and that
is bound to a DID, which is granted write access.  This is the point where
credentials are emitted into the world, and whence they are received and
consumed.

Any git-write with an appropriately signed commit.

## Commit Threads as Narrative

For any path through the commit history, taking into account branching and
merging, you can write down the sequence of decisions you make to navigate
to the genesis of a file - and transaction history establishes the Provenance
of the data.  The Narrative is the sequence of Provenance assertions, along
with the meta-data, and the Provenance itself is the unity of the Provenance
data.

Provenance Credentials are frozen GraphQL results against a Provenance data
structure, where the query is registered as a schema-primitive.
