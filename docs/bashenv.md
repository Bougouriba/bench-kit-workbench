# Bashenv

## QuickStart

- ```./bashenv/shell``` to start a fresh shell
- ```kd reset``` to reset the environment after changes

## Description

kd is a bash environment supporting development of the KIT Workbench.

It mixes 'within-environment' mutations along with pure-side-effect script
execution.

It uses a "Convention over Configuration" and heavily seeds a bash operating
environment with functions and variables, supporting multi-tech integration
projects.

It can be rapidly and ad-hoc adjusted, and it is specific to this repository,
meaning that all paths should be known and should be relative to the
KITWB_BASE_DIR directory, which is currently:
 = $KITWB_BASE_DIR

For more information, check out this file:
